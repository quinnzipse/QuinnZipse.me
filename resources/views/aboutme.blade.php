                        free time, I enjoy developing different software for personal or open use, and playing video
                        games.
                        I plan on studying computer science after I graduate in 2019.</p>
                    <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">I am currently employed at Target. I joined right after I turned
                        16 and have worked there ever since.</p>
                    <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">I have many projects I am currently working on including this
                        site, my robotics team website, and a controller for my smart home devices.</p>
